## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Project Setup

Project was initialized with

```shell
yarn create next-app next-fits
```

Afterwards folders `pages` and `styles` were moved to additionally created folder `src`.

Do no forget to copy `.env.example` file to `.env.local` or just `.env` whatever your setup should be and ajust values for required variables.
